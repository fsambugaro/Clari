MRCS - Apr 11 - On April 14th I'll have a meeting with David Mendes focusing on 3 topics:
1) Joint business case conclusion - he shall share their piece 
2) Meeting with Marcio Brito (Product Manager App Sebrae), since he'll return from vacations next week
3) Pharma offer - start this business case
--

MRCS - Mar 7 - Yesterday we had a meeting with David Mendes (Agenzia CEO). The idea is to focus initially on the Sebrae DN project due the higher volume and set the initial ETLA with a better entry pricing.

For the Sebrae the next steps are:

1) I'm working with PARS to present some proposal scenarios with 20k, 50k, 100k and 200k users.

2) I'll assist David Mendes (Agenzia CEO) to prepare a Business Case to present to Marcio (Sebrae DN).

3) We're asking an in person meeting with Marcio Brito (Product Manager App Sebrae) to present the business case


PROJECT CONTEXT:

What is the case?

- Agenzia already is a Sebrae DN supplier, providing Marketing solutions for Entrepreneurs within the Sebrae app.

- The Federal Government has made available a R$186B ($32B) budget for the digitalization of small industries through the Brasil Mais Produtivo (B+P) program in partnership with Sebrae. Last year, Sebrae had to return R$4B ($700M) from the Technology and Innovation budget to the Federal Government because they were unable to use it.

- Marcio Brito (Product Manager App Sebrae) is looking to deliver a high impact project aiming a promotion.

- Today Agenzia delivers campaigns for +200k Entrepreneurs, but the content is static without personalization.

- Agenzia wants to use Adobe Express to solve 2 challenges that they can't address today:
1) allow Entrepreneurs to create personalized content from the templates that Agenzia will provide; and
2) deliver the ability to create the most sophisticated content at scale, integrated with their systems (Express + Firefly Services).

- The idea is to make a pilot with 20k users, but already presenting the scenario to 50, 100 and 200k users.

- Phase 2 should also incorporate Firefly Services focusing on the second challenge.


Budget approved?

- Budget is approved (B+P program), we need to convince Sebrae to allocate the budget for this initiative right now.


Can it happen in Q2?

- Yes, we need 2 things:
1) Sebrae's buy-in
2) Validate if the investment for this new initiative can be included within the contract that Agenzia already has with Sebrae.


What is missing?

- Present the business case with Sebrae and identify how we can start this pilot.

- Qualify the purchase process, it can be done within the actual Agenzia agreement? What need to be done?


What are the next steps?

- Today we will share the proposal with the 4 scenarios for Agenzia

- Next week we will create the business case together with Agenzia

- In person meeting with Marcio to present the BC, probably in Brasilia.

--

MRCS - Mar 6 - Tomorrow we'll have a meeting with David Mendes (Agenzia CEO) to discuss the next steps.
--

MRCS - Jan 30 - Today we met with the Agenzia’s CEO David Mendes, Eder V (Tech Leader) here in the office, with Karen Vecchia and JC França.

Agenzia's solutions are already standard marketing platform on 2 major fronts:
Sebrae Nacional with 2M entrepreneurs CNPJs; and
Pharmacy Network with 90k pharmas.

Our solutions will solve two critical problems that they have failed to address so far:
- Deliver the ability to create more sophisticated content at scale, integrated with their systems (FFS); and
- allow business users to create custom content from templates that Agenzia will provide (Adobe Express).

We will move forward with both, the commercial discussion, as well with the technical conversation, supported by JC França.

We are initially talking about 3 possible scenarios:
- Pharmas Phase 1: 10k Express licenses and 2.4M FFS calls/year;
- Sebrae POC: 20k Express and 4.8 M calls from FFS/year; and
- Sebrae Phase 1: 100k Express and 25M FFS calls/year","CREATIVE EXPRESS","$0","0","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT BRAZIL","Sep 12, 2025","SP","$0","","Jan 31, 2025","Sales Organic","102","New","Q4","Pipeline","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001mkBTiQAM","USD","52.0","-1.0"

3. Will take approximately 20 days to execute, with result at the end of April, The invitation will be restricted to three providers, but if two participate, it won't be declared void.

May 05, 2025 JV: I met with Ruben Jauregui last Wednesday, when he confirmed that the 'Agencia Nacional Digital' had approved the budget. With this approval, the customer can finally begin the tender process. Typically, this process takes 20 business days; however, the customer plans to set shorter time frames for each step, reducing the total duration to 15 days and moving the adjudication to the last week of May. The next steps to execute are:

Week May 5th : 
*Request to Procurement Area open process and execute committee to review documents and publish process in ""Compra Net"".
* Tender will be open to resellers that sent proposals to study of market step.
*From our side, we must to finish internal process to cancel agreement.

JV 04/21/2025:  
1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen:  
After several meetings with Teresa Castillo and Ruben Jaureguí, the client confirms that the justification for the budget approval was sent to the “Agencia Nacional Digital”, from which a response is expected by April 28 due to processing times. We supported the client with information from Acrobat DC that we hope help them in this step. If they have no objections, the process will be opened as a priority in order to achieve the closing and awarding the last week of May. Several letters with CCE licensing requests have arrived at IPN, so they have a pressing event to make the purchase.

 2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen: 
Once they receive the aforementioned approval, they will open a priority purchase process, which we estimate could be released in May. For now the best estimation that we can havdoe according to the times of other cases is:
- April 30: Tender Publication  
- May 6: Q&A session  
- May 12: Opening of economic proposal  
- May 19: Publication of selected reseller  
- May 26–30: Purchase order placed with Adobe

5. Credit and budget
Waiting budget approvals.

AMIRA 4/14/2025
The market study has already begun and has been sent to the institutions that approve budgets to obtain purchase approval. We are awaiting this step in order to begin the bidding process, which may take an additional month. If the bidding process cannot be initiated this month, it will be postponed to the following month. We are on a two-week vacation period in education, and the process will likely be a little slower.


AMIRA 4-4-2025
I don't have a new status, time of this week for vacation time. 

AMIRA 3-27-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval, and the client is seeking budget approval and internal justification to give the green light to launch the formal bidding process, which can take from 15 days to a month.


AMIRA 3-21-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval.

AMIRA 3-13-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval.

AMIRA 3-6-2025
The market study was launched this week and the channels have until March 11th to send proposals. The review process normally lasts 1 month. The market study document does not specify steps or execution dates, but it is estimated that by the end of March we will have the winning channel of the process.
Special conditions: 9-month contract, 45 days credit.
Waiting for deal desk approval about 9 month contract.

AMIRA 2-28-2025
The market study process is about to be released, and the review of the proposals may take an additional month. The problem we have now is that the client needs to acquire only 9 months until December and in January start a 3-year agreement. We are in talks with operations to obtain this exception.

Secretaria de Hacienda released the budget but not the document to be able to execute it, they are waiting for this document so that they can execute the 2025 budget because the government practically never delivered it in 2024, the next steps are: --
1. have the document from the treasury
accredit Palo Tinto to sell the government
2. carry out a market study
3. start a tender with an approximate duration of 20 business days
4. failure of the tender

Hi team, about IPN, 
Secretaria de Hacienda released the budget but not the document to be able to execute it, they are waiting 


for this document so that they can execute the 2025 budget because the government practically never delivered it in 2024, the next steps are: --
 
1. Technical annex for which the IPN already has 
2. Market study that will begin this week 
3.Feasibility study that may take (5 business days) 
4. Approval of the internal committee (IPN Approvals and Purchases Committee) (15 business days) 
5. Approval of digital strategy (15 business days) 
6. Tender (20 business days) Invitation to at least 3 suppliers
 
It is important to mention that the Mexican government is not allocating funds for public education. It has a new software factory initiative so that its institutions can manufacture their own software and not depend on third parties. They are waiting for the budget to be executed by 2025 and for the government to stop keeping these funds. This is the greatest risk we have now.
 
Amira, Jan 13, 2025, 
Today I have a face-to-face meeting with Teresa, IPN's IT manager, to define the next steps and times that the project can take. Once I have them, I will make the corresponding report. They told me that the new market study should be released this week.

Jan 10, 2025: No change in status. There will be an update from IPN about the final budget assigned and if the approval process will start over again. 

AMIRA 12-20-24
The client told us that they will have a response today or on Monday based on the review of the proposals. The response may or may not be favorable. If it is favorable, they will tell us the channel they want to work with, and if it is not favorable, we will have to wait for the budget to be released in January 2025 and start the approval process again.

AMIRA 12-12-24
Since Friday, December 6th, the participating channels Digita, Tenker and Palo Tinto sent their proposals to the client for review. This week, these proposals are being reviewed. They are looking to decide on the best option based on these proposals and not have to go out to tender, since they must award the contract to the channel in December, or they will lose the funds.

AMIRA 12-6-24
This week, the quotes and documentation were requested from the 3 suppliers selected by the IPN. They told us that the formal invitation process for 3 would take place the following week in order to have the tender result on December.

AMIRA 12-2-24
1. This week we need the result from Hacienda for use the budget, Once the budget is available, it will be decided whether it is done by direct award or by invitation to 3; this is decided by the acquisitions committee within the IPN.
This process by invitation to 3 takes 15 days to execute so it is still December.
4. Once the above is fulfilled, the Deal Desk sends us the PSO and Nexsys has to sign the PSO

AMIRA 11-25-24
1. We are waiting for the direct award to be issued by the IPN
2. We are waiting for the compliance agreement between Adobe and Palo Tinto to be signed
3. Nexsys confirms to us today if the line of credit for the channel is approved
4. Once the above is fulfilled, the Deal Desk sends us the PSO and Nexsys has to sign the PSO

Adobe, waiting for credit approval so that Nagaraj can release the agreements and send them for signature.
IPN, today is not a working day in Mexico but this week the direct award should be released and the agreements signed between IPN and the Palo Tinto Networks channel.
Palo Tinto is already a certified Adobe channel and also already has a credit line in Nexsys to be able to place the order.

AMIRA 11-8-24
I requested legal documents from Clarice. I am waiting for them and the letter from Vinay for the partnr Palo Tinto Networks requested by the client. It seems that it will be a direct award that will be made in November 2024.

AMIRA 11-4-24
last week the only approval of the Treasury was released so that IPN can bid, this week the bidding process will begin, which is expected to last 20 working days.

AMIRA 10-28-24
These are the points we touched on in last Thursday's session
1. We still need to check if the market study is still valid or if it needs to be requested again from the (General Directorate of Programming and Budget). It takes approximately 5 days for validation. This Friday the request would be released in case the previous one is no longer valid.

2. The technical annex will remain the same, only the dates would be changed.

3. Apostilled letters for the invited channels have already been requested.

4. We need to validate if the bidding process can be carried out in shorter times. Even so, it is expected to take 15 to 20 days to execute it.

5. It is one of the most advanced projects, so we will be able to complete it this year.

AMIRA 10-20-24
After several meetings, we are still looking for the Treasury to approve that it can be tendered this year, otherwise we have to ask for approvals from CEDN again and wait for the budget for the following year to be released and the size could be closed until March, April 2025, I asked Javier, my boss, to send an email to Eng. Leonardo Rafael Sánchez Ferreiro (General Coordinator of the National Computing Center) (rsferrei@ipn.mx) to ask him to support us by speeding up the process and prioritizing it.
Since October 15, they no longer have service, I asked the CSM for support to detect what the systems show because despite not having service, the IT area has not had any complaints.
I already have a meeting next Thursday with Maria Teresa, head of IT, to review the tender bases.

The risk was detected on May 6th, 2024, CEDN (Coordination of National Digital Strategy) approved the project for Instituto Politecnico Nacional for its 2024 software licensing, a process that took 6 months. Due to the electoral period, Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico communicates that the acquisitions were suspended, our election in Mexico was on June 2th and the statement indicated that they would be reactivated in October 2024. On October 4, 2024, a new statement from Finance and Public Credit arrives indicating again that the bidding, direct award or acquisition processes are suspended until further notice. We are supporting the client to obtain the tax exemption in this process. I will have a meeting with them today.","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$0","0","Accepted","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","Nov 29, 2024","DIF","$0","","Nov 4, 2024","Sales Joint with Partners","8","New","Q2","Pipeline","ETLA- Standard","Palo Tinto Networks","0065Y00001miDM9QAM","USD","81.0","-1.0"

The budget has already been approved, and all required documentation has been submitted and corrected. Our contact, José Antonio Rafta, confirmed that the RFP must be published this month without fail. While his department is not directly responsible for publishing it, he informed us that many bidding processes are starting to be released, so we have visibility and a strong likelihood of closing.

Lili Apr 11, 2025: We met with José Antonio Rafta on Tuesday, April 8, to walk him through how the ETLA console works and provide clarity on the license deployment process. During the meeting, he mentioned that the tender must be published this month without fail. If that happens, we are perfectly on time to place the order within Q2.

Lili Apr 04, 2025: The client requested to schedule a meeting during the week of April 7–11 in order to gain a detailed understanding of the ETLA console. The purpose is to understand the provisioning process and be prepared for when the licenses are acquired.

Lili Mar 28, 2025: On Monday, March 17, José Antonio Rafta sent the complete file to his procurement team. He confirmed that all the information is correct and that no additional data is required.
He also informed us that the tender is expected to be published in April.

Lili Mar 13, 2025: The customer is still analyzing the market study, and so far, we have not encountered any issues.  
Once the review of the study is completed, the budget will be officially allocated to the customer, and the public tender will take place.

Lili Mar 06, 2025: We are currently awaiting the publication of the tender, which is expected to take place between March 15th and 20th.

Lili Feb 28, 2025: The client has published the market study, and today, February 28, is the deadline for submitting financial proposals. Subsequently, these proposals will be analyzed with the goal of obtaining formal budget approval. The tender is expected to be published in mid-March, with the aim of awarding the contract in early April.


Lili Feb 14, 2025: The client experienced some delays in the scheduled timeline. This week, the procurement department indicated the need to make certain adjustments to the technical annex, which led to the implementation of these changes. Once procurement gives its approval, they will be able to resume the market study process.

Estimated Timeline:

End of February: Publication of the market study.
End of March: Publication of the tender.
Mid-April: Awarding of the winning supplier.

Lili Jan 31, 2025: The client was unable to conduct the market study this week because the procurement department suggested doing it in February to align it with the month of the bidding process.  

Therefore, we will wait until the week of **February 3rd to 7th** for them to carry out the market study.

**Process Timeline:**  
- **Market Study:** February 3 or 4.  
- **Bidding:** February 10 to 14.  
- **Awarding:** February 25 or 26.  
- **Issuance of the Purchase Order to Adobe:** February 27.  

Please note that there is a possibility of this timeline shifting to the first week of Q2.

Lili Jan 24, 2025: The FGR is expected to republish its market study next week, approximately on Thursday, January 29. Subsequently, the tender should be published during the week of February 3 to 7.

If the timeline proceeds as expected, we would still be in a position to process this purchase order within Q1.


Lili Jan 16, 2025: I had a meeting with the client, who mentioned that they only need to have all the documentation ready to proceed with the technical annex and publish the tender. They requested some Gartner analyses to justify and validate the content of the technical annex.

Next step: We need customer to confirm which model they will adhere:
- If they chose to restructure the agreement they already have the related SO to get Legal approval and signature - we're pushing them to run the Legal evaluation along with the commercial model approval.
- If they chose to keep the True Up, I'll share the Deployment Letter for signature.

Diego understood both technologies can help TAM, but there is a concern regarding security, that's why they migrated from I Love PDF to Acrobat - and I explained that the AIA security is the same as Acrobat and I shared all the security information the day after the meeting.

I just sent an email asking Diego about a decision, if they will migrate or we should  proceed with the True Up.

I requested a meeting to review the pricing proposal and let them know that if the deal is processed this month, they could qualify for a higher discount.
I’m hoping to hear back from the client later today.


Lili May 01, 2025: I contacted Neftalí IT Director , on Wednesday, April 30, but he mentioned he would be taking a few days off and asked me to reach out again on Wednesday, May 7 to check if he has received a response from Brazil regarding the purchase.

Lili Apr 22, 2025:  
1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
The client needs to acquire licenses by early June to support new operations in Mexico and LATAM. We offered a discount to encourage them to accelerate the process and complete the purchase by the end of May. The budget is available, and the client has expressed a strong interest in our proposal. They are only waiting for formal approval from the Brazil office.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen

April 25: Expected formal approval from Brazil (per Neftali, IT Director)
May 5–15: Reseller onboarding as a vendor (takes approx. 10 days)
May 20–24: ETLA contract to be sent to the client for signature
May 28: Follow-up with the client for updates
Last week of May: Purchase order processing in Adobe

3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
Submitted on Monday, April 21, but DD team has not yet picked up the case.

4. Legal stairs
The ETLA contract will be sent to the client for signature during the week of May 20. No special legal clauses are expected at this stage.

o Voomp
Image generation by information producers. Currently, many information producers create and upload content on our Voomp Creators platform. We have a great opportunity to offer image generation and editing services for content creation and marketing campaigns
o Martech
Today, we have an in-house creative team for creating and deploying advertising pieces for digital media (Google, Meta, TikTok, and whatever else we use in digital) and another creative team for Trade and SEO content. In other words, all the campaigns we launch have some type of image and video media that Firefly could help us with
o Academic
I understand that we are already piloting the Adobe CMS within Cogna, however, I understand that it will take some time for all journeys to be within the CMS process, therefore, if we can make Firefly available through other platforms, we understand that we will have a great gain in operational efficiency.

Current volume of image generation within Cogna IA Corporate Chat;

We agreed to send this information between Monday, March 31, and Tuesday, April 1.
I will coordinate with Clarice to send the letter so we can move forward with the process.

I spoke with Noel and the sign project was stopped until further notice by the user area, however we are working on a project for the acquisition of student licenses that Noel has to present to the approval committee, this process may take a little longer, which is why I am going to move this account to Q2.

CIO Noel will speak with the team that submitted the SIGN request to validate how the process is going. They already have a budget and if the team wants, the bidding process can be started. It takes 2 weeks. The week of the 10th to the 14th, proposals will be opened so that the channels can send the information and the following 2 weeks for the review of proposals, obtaining the winner at the end of February.
As an additional thing, the following Tuesday they want to validate the additional purchase of licenses for students. Once we have the information, we will create the new opportunity.

It’s important that we process them no later than Friday, May 16.


Lili May 01, 2025: I’ve already sent the contract to the client and I’m currently waiting for it to be signed. With Televisa, this process is usually a bit slow, but this time they assured me they will move quickly. According to what they told me, they plan to send the purchase orders next week and sign the ETLA contract during that same period.


Lili Apr 25, 2025: The financial proposals have already been sent to the client for each division (Play City, Editorial Televisa, Club América, among others). We are currently waiting to receive the purchase orders and for DD to send us the contracts.
DD is expected to send the contracts during the week of April 28 to May 2. The client is expected to sign them during the week of May 5 to May 9. During these two weeks, we should also receive the corresponding purchase orders.


Lili Apr 22, 2025:1. 
1.Reason why you believe it’s going to happen

The customer requested to separate these licenses from the G. Televisa ETLA (small contract) because they are now publicly traded and must have independent contracts. The client is aware that this transition must occur before May 10. All quotes have already been shared, and we are currently waiting for the purchase orders. This will not impact attrition in the region.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen

April 22–26: Follow-up with DD team for case assignment
April 29 – May 3: Customer to issue purchase orders
May 6–10: Order processing in Adobe
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
Still pending. Case was submitted and follow-up emails have been sent, but DD has not yet picked it up.

4. Legal stairs
No additional legal review is expected as this is a standard ETLA. 

5. Credit and budget
Customer has budget approval and is in final steps to issue purchase orders.","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$0","0","Accepted","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","May 23, 2025","DF","$0","","Apr 21, 2025","Sales Organic","0","New","Q2","Pipeline","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001nJSwDQAW","USD","55.0","-1.0"

Timeline
April 22–30: Wait for the official RFP publication
Early May: Submit question to validate ETLA acceptance during Q&A
Mid May: Share formal proposal under ETLA scheme
Late May to early June: Customer to complete internal process and place PO
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
To be initiated once customer confirms scheme (VIP or ETLA) via Q&A session.


Lili Apr 22, 2025: 1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
The client will soon publish the bidding guidelines under the VIP scheme, but based on prior discussions, they are open to an ETLA structure as well. This can be confirmed during the upcoming Q&A session. The budget was approved last year, and due to upcoming leadership changes at Banobras—including the expected replacement of César, the current IT Director—there is urgency to finalize licensing before the transition.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen
April 22–30: Wait for the official RFP publication
Early May: Submit question to validate ETLA acceptance during Q&A
Mid May: Share formal proposal under ETLA scheme
Late May to early June: Customer to complete internal process and place PO
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
To be initiated once customer confirms scheme (VIP or ETLA) via Q&A session.

4. Legal stairs
No legal action required at this point. Will depend on chosen licensing scheme and RFP structure.

5. Credit and budget
Budget has been approved since last year.

Lili Apr 11, 2025: A friend who works at Banobras mentioned that there will be changes within the institution and that César will be replaced. This means César will need to launch the tender either this month or, at the latest, next month in order to carry out the process before his departure. This aligns with what the client had told us.

Lili Apr 04, 2025: The client has confirmed that they were unable to make the modification in the technical annex. However, they mentioned that once the RFP is published, I can ask whether the contract can be managed under the ETLA model, and the client will confirm that it can. The RFP is expected to be published either this month or in early May.

Lili Mar 28, 2025: I reviewed with the client the available options to make the modification, and they requested more information about the Enterprise and ETLA schemes.
I shared the relevant details, and they mentioned they will have more updates next Thursday.

Lili Mar 13, 2025: I am working with the customer to assess the possibility of modifying their technical annex for **ETLA**. I had a conversation with them on **Monday, March 10**, and I expect to receive updates during the week of **March 24-28** to determine the feasibility of this option.

Lili Mar 06, 2025: César M., head of the procurement area, has not granted us a meeting. However, this week I’ve been in contact with different user areas to apply pressure and follow up on the Adobe service contract.

I will continue trying to reach César, and if I’m unable to secure the meeting within two weeks, I will move this opportunity to Q3.
Lili Feb 28, 2025: I am coordinating a meeting with the client in the coming weeks to secure the licensing purchase. I don't have a confirmed date yet, but I hope it will take place between March 3 and March 14.

Lili Feb 14, 2025: The client is currently assessing whether they need to conduct a market study or if they can proceed directly with a tender process. I am working with the client to ensure their process correctly reflects *ETLA*; however, due to time constraints and recent changes in the government, they are still uncertain about the possibility of making modifications to the technical annex.

Lili Jan 16, 2025: The client decided to suspend the process due to a lack of resources. I have a scheduled in-person meeting next week with Marcos Pinto to discuss when the procurement process will be re-published.

Jan 10, 2025: No change in status. We're awaiting the client’s decision on the number of licenses, which is expected to happen during the week of January 20th.

Lili Dec 27, 2024: We are awaiting the client’s decision on the number of licenses, which is expected to happen during the week of January 20th.

Lili Dec 20, 2024: The client has already published their bid for maximums and minimums.  
- Clarifications meeting: December 17th (completed)  
- Proposal submission and opening, and award decision: December 26th  
- Contract signing and placing the order with Adobe: January 20th  

Lili 10 dic 2024: **CRM Comment:**  
I have been working with BANOBRAS for over a year, initially focusing on PDF Services, which later evolved into a need for Acrobat Pro.  

The main contact is Marcos Pinto, IT Procurement Director, and the account is looking to implement Acrobat with SSO integration to avoid requiring users to log in every time they access the program. For this reason, they are not interested in a costly solution like the VIP program.  

Efforts have been made to ensure that their tender specifies a preference for an Enterprise agreement. The tender is scheduled to be published on Tuesday, December 10, or Wednesday, December 11.","ACROBAT","$0","0","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","Sep 30, 2024","DIF","$0","","Apr 23, 2024","Sales Organic","154","New","Q3","Pipeline","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001lk8y0QAA","USD","54.0","-1.0"

Marcos - Oct 21 - On Oct 17 we initiated the formal evaluation by the AI Group at Globo, part of the Workplace Department.

Although the Firefly evaluation process will require several steps, including Security and Compliance reviews, I believe we can speed up the AI Assistant process.

For AI Assistant Globo is asking for a POC, the idea is that the AI Group test the solution in a controlled environment and to present the results at the AI Project 1st Year Celebration in November, already suggesting some use cases for the solution.

Next steps: Identify how to deliver a POC to Globo.

To be on top of this process and help eliminating eventual blocks, we scheduled a cadence with Globo, starting next Monday October 21th with a Firefly technical overview and business discussion - we'll also talk about the AI Assistant POC

They are going to tender this month to start their agreement on May 1, 2025. At the moment, they have not told us about any risks. After checking with Vanesa, we did not find any overuse, so they will renew the same amount.

I don't have a new status, time of this week for vacation time. 

AMIRA 3-27-2025
There really wasn't overuse, but their console was very disorganized. Vanessa helped them get it organized. There are still several VIP consoles that are no longer valid. They will have a small increase in their licensing this year because the government has had a very large budget reduction.

The client is delayed in its internal processes, its tender is dated one month after the expiration date, a quote for an additional month has already been sent, we are waiting for a response from the client to know if they will pay for this extension or not / we have a meeting with them today.

AMIRA 3-6-2025
We had the session scheduled for this Thursday but the client asked us to reschedule it for the following week. We have already identified the overuse on the console, but we need to discuss it with the client and reach an agreement.
The meeting will be with Federico Razo TI Director.


AMIRA 2-28-25
We found an excess in overuse of licensing, and we have a meeting with the client next week to discuss it.
We will have a meeting next week with Federico Razo TI Director.

AMIRA 6-27-24
The tender was declared void, the following week a new tender will be opened and we will have results in 15 business days","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$21,560","21,560","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","May 2, 2025","DIF","$21,560","","Apr 2, 2024","Sales Organic","74","Renewal","Q2","Pipeline","VIP Custom","","0065Y00001lbZS7QAM","USD","62.0","-1.0"

MRCS - Apr 11 - DD advise that BU denied this add-on deal due the small value.

We're asking for an exception since Globo is the most important customer in the Commercial vertical in Latam. We have more than $1M ARR including Creative Solutions, Document Cloud solutions and Frame.io.

Globo can not use the True Up model, they need to pay in advance.

This limitation not just open space for Adobe Stock competitors, they’ll license other stock solution, but can also jeopardize all efforts we’ve been doing to promote the Firefly upgrade with Stock Premium and even the AI Assistant adoption - we just started a POC/trial right now.
