We're asking for an exception since Globo is the most important customer in the Commercial vertical in Latam. We have more than $1M ARR including Creative Solutions, Document Cloud solutions and Frame.io.

Globo can not use the True Up model, they need to pay in advance.

This limitation not just open space for Adobe Stock competitors, they’ll license other stock solution, but can also jeopardize all efforts we’ve been doing to promote the Firefly upgrade with Stock Premium and even the AI Assistant adoption - we just started a POC/trial right now.

--

MRCS - Apr 18 - This week we were at Globo with a full schedule of meetings and events where we engaged more than 200 attendees. We spoke with several areas like Workplace (manages CC and DC agreement); Sports & Journalism and Promo/Chamadas (Calls), heavy CC users; AI Committee (Firefly discussion and the AI Assistant POC); and Media Solutions in Post-Production (manages Frame.io).

⁃     AI Assistant:

The trial licenses are not accessible to all Employees and Leandro (who is leading the POC) and Diego Silva (SC) managed to solve some cases and opened a support ticket to solve the problem.

Next step: After fixing the licenses, we'll deliver a workshop with the POC attendees and choose some use cases with the greatest potential to support them.

--

Marcos - Oct 21 - On Oct 17 we initiated the formal evaluation by the AI Group at Globo, part of the Workplace Department.

Although the Firefly evaluation process will require several steps, including Security and Compliance reviews, I believe we can speed up the AI Assistant process.

For AI Assistant Globo is asking for a POC, the idea is that the AI Group test the solution in a controlled environment and to present the results at the AI Project 1st Year Celebration in November, already suggesting some use cases for the solution.

Next steps: Identify how to deliver a POC to Globo.

To be on top of this process and help eliminating eventual blocks, we scheduled a cadence with Globo, starting next Monday October 21th with a Firefly technical overview and business discussion - we'll also talk about the AI Assistant POC

o Voomp
Image generation by information producers. Currently, many information producers create and upload content on our Voomp Creators platform. We have a great opportunity to offer image generation and editing services for content creation and marketing campaigns
o Martech
Today, we have an in-house creative team for creating and deploying advertising pieces for digital media (Google, Meta, TikTok, and whatever else we use in digital) and another creative team for Trade and SEO content. In other words, all the campaigns we launch have some type of image and video media that Firefly could help us with
o Academic
I understand that we are already piloting the Adobe CMS within Cogna, however, I understand that it will take some time for all journeys to be within the CMS process, therefore, if we can make Firefly available through other platforms, we understand that we will have a great gain in operational efficiency.

MRCS - Jan 30 - Today we met with the Agenzia’s CEO David Mendes, Eder V (Tech Leader) here in the office, with Karen Vecchia and JC França.
  
Agenzia's solutions are already standard marketing platform on 2 major fronts:
Sebrae Nacional with 2M entrepreneurs CNPJs; and
Pharmacy Network with 90k pharmas.
 
Our solutions will solve two critical problems that they have failed to address so far:
- Deliver the ability to create more sophisticated content at scale, integrated with their systems (FFS); and
- allow business users to create custom content from templates that Agenzia will provide (Adobe Express).
 
We will move forward with both, the commercial discussion, as well with the technical conversation, supported by JC França.
 
We are initially talking about 3 possible scenarios:
- Pharmas Phase 1: 10k Express licenses and 2.4M FFS calls/year;
- Sebrae POC: 20k Express and 4.8 M calls from FFS/year; and
- Sebrae Phase 1: 100k Express and 25M FFS calls/year

Timeline
April 22–30: Wait for the official RFP publication
Early May: Submit question to validate ETLA acceptance during Q&A
Mid May: Share formal proposal under ETLA scheme
Late May to early June: Customer to complete internal process and place PO
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
To be initiated once customer confirms scheme (VIP or ETLA) via Q&A session.


Lili Apr 22, 2025: 1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
The client will soon publish the bidding guidelines under the VIP scheme, but based on prior discussions, they are open to an ETLA structure as well. This can be confirmed during the upcoming Q&A session. The budget was approved last year, and due to upcoming leadership changes at Banobras—including the expected replacement of César, the current IT Director—there is urgency to finalize licensing before the transition.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen
April 22–30: Wait for the official RFP publication
Early May: Submit question to validate ETLA acceptance during Q&A
Mid May: Share formal proposal under ETLA scheme
Late May to early June: Customer to complete internal process and place PO
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
To be initiated once customer confirms scheme (VIP or ETLA) via Q&A session.

4. Legal stairs
No legal action required at this point. Will depend on chosen licensing scheme and RFP structure.

5. Credit and budget
Budget has been approved since last year.

Lili Apr 11, 2025: A friend who works at Banobras mentioned that there will be changes within the institution and that César will be replaced. This means César will need to launch the tender either this month or, at the latest, next month in order to carry out the process before his departure. This aligns with what the client had told us.

Lili Apr 04, 2025: The client has confirmed that they were unable to make the modification in the technical annex. However, they mentioned that once the RFP is published, I can ask whether the contract can be managed under the ETLA model, and the client will confirm that it can. The RFP is expected to be published either this month or in early May.

Lili Mar 28, 2025: I reviewed with the client the available options to make the modification, and they requested more information about the Enterprise and ETLA schemes.
I shared the relevant details, and they mentioned they will have more updates next Thursday.

Lili Mar 13, 2025: I am working with the customer to assess the possibility of modifying their technical annex for **ETLA**. I had a conversation with them on **Monday, March 10**, and I expect to receive updates during the week of **March 24-28** to determine the feasibility of this option.

Lili Mar 06, 2025: César M., head of the procurement area, has not granted us a meeting. However, this week I’ve been in contact with different user areas to apply pressure and follow up on the Adobe service contract.

I will continue trying to reach César, and if I’m unable to secure the meeting within two weeks, I will move this opportunity to Q3.
Lili Feb 28, 2025: I am coordinating a meeting with the client in the coming weeks to secure the licensing purchase. I don't have a confirmed date yet, but I hope it will take place between March 3 and March 14.

Lili Feb 14, 2025: The client is currently assessing whether they need to conduct a market study or if they can proceed directly with a tender process. I am working with the client to ensure their process correctly reflects *ETLA*; however, due to time constraints and recent changes in the government, they are still uncertain about the possibility of making modifications to the technical annex.

Lili Jan 16, 2025: The client decided to suspend the process due to a lack of resources. I have a scheduled in-person meeting next week with Marcos Pinto to discuss when the procurement process will be re-published.

Jan 10, 2025: No change in status. We're awaiting the client’s decision on the number of licenses, which is expected to happen during the week of January 20th.

Lili Dec 27, 2024: We are awaiting the client’s decision on the number of licenses, which is expected to happen during the week of January 20th.

Lili Dec 20, 2024: The client has already published their bid for maximums and minimums.  
- Clarifications meeting: December 17th (completed)  
- Proposal submission and opening, and award decision: December 26th  
- Contract signing and placing the order with Adobe: January 20th  

Lili 10 dic 2024: **CRM Comment:**  
I have been working with BANOBRAS for over a year, initially focusing on PDF Services, which later evolved into a need for Acrobat Pro.  

The main contact is Marcos Pinto, IT Procurement Director, and the account is looking to implement Acrobat with SSO integration to avoid requiring users to log in every time they access the program. For this reason, they are not interested in a costly solution like the VIP program.  

Efforts have been made to ensure that their tender specifies a preference for an Enterprise agreement. The tender is scheduled to be published on Tuesday, December 10, or Wednesday, December 11.","ACROBAT","$0","0","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","Sep 30, 2024","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","","DIF","$50,268.82","$0","","Apr 23, 2024","Sales Organic","154","New","Q3","Pipeline","Government - Federal","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001lk8y0QAA","USD","54.0","-1.0"

5. Credit and budget
The budget has already been approved by FGR.



Lili Apr 11, 2025: We met with José Antonio Rafta on Tuesday, April 8, to walk him through how the ETLA console works and provide clarity on the license deployment process. During the meeting, he mentioned that the tender must be published this month without fail. If that happens, we are perfectly on time to place the order within Q2.

Lili Apr 04, 2025: The client requested to schedule a meeting during the week of April 7–11 in order to gain a detailed understanding of the ETLA console. The purpose is to understand the provisioning process and be prepared for when the licenses are acquired.

Lili Mar 28, 2025: On Monday, March 17, José Antonio Rafta sent the complete file to his procurement team. He confirmed that all the information is correct and that no additional data is required.
He also informed us that the tender is expected to be published in April.

Lili Mar 13, 2025: The customer is still analyzing the market study, and so far, we have not encountered any issues.  
Once the review of the study is completed, the budget will be officially allocated to the customer, and the public tender will take place.

Lili Mar 06, 2025: We are currently awaiting the publication of the tender, which is expected to take place between March 15th and 20th.

Lili Feb 28, 2025: The client has published the market study, and today, February 28, is the deadline for submitting financial proposals. Subsequently, these proposals will be analyzed with the goal of obtaining formal budget approval. The tender is expected to be published in mid-March, with the aim of awarding the contract in early April.


Lili Feb 14, 2025: The client experienced some delays in the scheduled timeline. This week, the procurement department indicated the need to make certain adjustments to the technical annex, which led to the implementation of these changes. Once procurement gives its approval, they will be able to resume the market study process.

Estimated Timeline:

End of February: Publication of the market study.
End of March: Publication of the tender.
Mid-April: Awarding of the winning supplier.

Lili Jan 31, 2025: The client was unable to conduct the market study this week because the procurement department suggested doing it in February to align it with the month of the bidding process.  

Therefore, we will wait until the week of **February 3rd to 7th** for them to carry out the market study.

**Process Timeline:**  
- **Market Study:** February 3 or 4.  
- **Bidding:** February 10 to 14.  
- **Awarding:** February 25 or 26.  
- **Issuance of the Purchase Order to Adobe:** February 27.  

Please note that there is a possibility of this timeline shifting to the first week of Q2.

Lili Jan 24, 2025: The FGR is expected to republish its market study next week, approximately on Thursday, January 29. Subsequently, the tender should be published during the week of February 3 to 7.

If the timeline proceeds as expected, we would still be in a position to process this purchase order within Q1.


Lili Jan 16, 2025: I had a meeting with the client, who mentioned that they only need to have all the documentation ready to proceed with the technical annex and publish the tender. They requested some Gartner analyses to justify and validate the content of the technical annex.

Jan 10, 2024 :The client is currently on vacation, so we will resume discussions second week of January to confirm if the technical annex is ready to proceed with the publication of the tender. We are currently in contact with José Antonio Rafta.

Lili Dec 27, 2024: The client is currently on vacation, so we will resume discussions at the beginning of January to confirm if the technical annex is ready to proceed with the publication of the tender. We are currently in contact with José Antonio Rafta.

Lili Dec 20, 2024: The client is currently on vacation, so we will resume discussions at the beginning of January to confirm if the technical annex is ready to proceed with the publication of the tender. We are currently in contact with José Antonio Rafta.

Lili Dec 18, 2024: The client is currently on vacation, so we will resume discussions at the beginning of January to confirm if the technical annex is ready to proceed with the publication of the tender. We are currently in contact with José Antonio Rafta.


Lili Dec 06, 2024: The client is still working on the technical annex. We expect it to be ready by December 13 at the latest, allowing the tender to be published by mid-January and awarded in February.


Lili Dec 02, 2024: Due to time constraints, the client has decided to schedule the procurement for late February. Currently, they are working on drafting their tender, which is expected to be published by mid-January 2025. It is important to note that the agency (FGR) will begin its vacation period on December 15.


Lili Oct 11, 2024: According to an official communication issued by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to all government agencies, it is indicated that contracts not under competition will be postponed until next year. Therefore, this business will take place in January or February 2025.

Lili Oct 03, 2024:  I am working with DD to finalize the costs for this project. We are waiting for the final tender to be published, which is expected this year, although I cannot guarantee it will be in Q4.","ACROBAT","$0","0","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","Aug 13, 2024","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","","DIF","$345,760","$0","","Apr 9, 2024","Sales Organic","74","New","Q3","Pipeline","Government - Federal","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001lbiFxQAI","USD","82.0","-1.0"

AMIRA 3-21-2025
We had a call this week with the client, and although they have duplicate users due to a poor console migration, they aren't using additional users. They are defining the final scenario for their renewal. They will deliver it to us next week, although the amount will most likely be lower.


AMIRA 3-13-2025
This week, a notification of overuse was sent to the client. We have a meeting next Wednesday to review this issue.

AMIRA 3-6-2025
Checking in the console we found and over usage of 1279 creative licenses, Vane CSM is writing an email to notify the client, they are about to pay their 2nd annual contract payment, it is likely that this over usage is not budgeted, and we will have to negotiate it, we wait that the client will give us a meeting next week.","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$441,972.10","220,680","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","May 9, 2027","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","","DIF","$462,135.97","$441,972.10","In House Development","Apr 22, 2025","Sales Organic","13","Restructure","Q3","Omitted","Education - Higher Ed","ETLA- Hybrid","","0065Y00001nJUM8QAO","USD","0.0","-1.0"
