Next step is to review the real consumption to make the forecast for the year.
Apr 24, 2025 :
Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
I believe that the work of JC Franca locally in the week of 6 May with the customer to make a development for them to solve the transaction issue in the report will allow us to close this quarter.

Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen : STEP 1 Resolve the technical issue of reporting… For the customer, it is important to keep track of the telemetry level of the solution because they are consuming too much and it is out of their budget. They need to look at the budget in each area that uses the tool and they need detailed information to do that. 
STEP 2 We need to work with the customer based on the correct information to forecast the monthly consumption and, based on that, place the purchase order for the total until the end of their contract.

DD status: We are waiting to solve the reporting issues to have the correct number of transactions to upload the deal. The pricing it´s in the ETLA.

Legal stairs: No issue.

Credit and Budget: The customer doesn´t have the budget but they are overconsuming in SIGN so that need to be paid and Nexsys locally offer them credit.

Apr 18, 2025 The customer is very angry about the reporting problems. I accept the solution of JC Franca coming and the date will be May 5th.

Apr 11, 2025 The customer is very angry about the reporting problems. I accept the solution of JC Franca coming and the date will be May 5th.

Mar 28, 2025 the client is very angry about the reporting problems. I accept the solution of JC Franca coming and the date will be May 5th.

Mar 14, 2025 The client was approached about the possibility of helping in the development to solve the reporting problems of the solution. Next step to move forward with JC Franca with the client.
Mar 07, 2025 We are waiting in the SIGN transaction´s reporter's office with the new view. The investment was requested in the QBR in order to develop a tailor-made solution for the customer.","SIGN","$0","0","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","Apr 19, 2025","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","","Region Metropolitana","$200,000","$0","","Feb 18, 2025","Sales Organic","39","Add On","Q2","Pipeline","Retail","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001nI5sNQAS","USD","55.0","-1.0"

1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
The client needs to acquire licenses by early June to support new operations in Mexico and LATAM. We offered a discount to encourage them to accelerate the process and complete the purchase by the end of May. The budget is available, and the client has expressed a strong interest in our proposal. They are only waiting for formal approval from the Brazil office.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen

April 25: Expected formal approval from Brazil (per Neftali, IT Director)
May 5–15: Reseller onboarding as a vendor (takes approx. 10 days)
May 20–24: ETLA contract to be sent to the client for signature
May 28: Follow-up with the client for updates
Last week of May: Purchase order processing in Adobe

3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
Submitted on Monday, April 21, but DD team has not yet picked up the case.

4. Legal stairs

Lili Apr 25, 2025: The financial proposals have already been sent to the client for each division (Play City, Editorial Televisa, Club América, among others). We are currently waiting to receive the purchase orders and for DD to send us the contracts.
DD is expected to send the contracts during the week of April 28 to May 2. The client is expected to sign them during the week of May 5 to May 9. During these two weeks, we should also receive the corresponding purchase orders.

The customer requested to separate these licenses from the G. Televisa ETLA (small contract) because they are now publicly traded and must have independent contracts. The client is aware that this transition must occur before May 10. All quotes have already been shared, and we are currently waiting for the purchase orders. This will not impact attrition in the region.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen

April 22–26: Follow-up with DD team for case assignment
April 29 – May 3: Customer to issue purchase orders
May 6–10: Order processing in Adobe
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
Still pending. Case was submitted and follow-up emails have been sent, but DD has not yet picked it up.

4. Legal stairs
No additional legal review is expected as this is a standard ETLA. 

5. Credit and budget
Customer has budget approval and is in final steps to issue purchase orders.","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$0","0","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","May 23, 2025","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS","","MEX","$150,000","$0","","Apr 21, 2025","Sales Organic","8","New","Q2","Pipeline","Professional & Technical Services","ETLA- Standard","","0065Y00001nJSwDQAW","USD","89.0","-1.0"

Lili Apr 25, 2025: The proposal was sent to the customer on Thursday, April 24. We are currently waiting for their response, although the customer is comparing it against an educational price offered by the phones team in Greece. I will contact the customer on Wednesday, April 30 to check if they have any feedback or updates.

Lili Apr 22, 2025: 
1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen
The customer has already approved the budget. However, they received significantly lower pricing through Adobe.com, including educational discounts. Our strategy is to process this deal through VIP Custu to offer more competitive pricing and guide the customer toward a global contract structure, which is their main interest.

2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen
April 22–23: Awaiting system update to request competitive pricing via VIP Custu
April 29 – May 3: Share new pricing with the customer
May 6–10: Align contract structure and validate global contract interest
Mid-to-late May: Customer to issue purchase order and process VIP Custum contract
3. DD Status (Due Diligence)
Not required for VIP Custu at this stage. Pricing approval pending due to system updates.

4. Legal stairs
No legal review required 

5. Credit and budget
Budget is already approved by the customer.

As soon as the clause is approved, we will proceed with placing the purchase order. This is expected to happen during the week of April 14–18.

Lili Apr 04, 2025: The client has already signed the financial proposal. I’m currently waiting for DD to send me the contracts so I can share them with the client on Monday, April 7. During the week of April 7 to 11, the client is expected to provide the purchase order, and on Friday, April 11, the partner must submit the purchase order to Adobe. 

Lili Mar 28, 2025: The client is currently in communication with representatives from the Adobe.com call center. We’ve already informed them that we can improve any offer they receive through that channel. However, they haven’t yet shared the details of the proposal with us.

I’ll follow up with them on Monday to check what stage they’re at.

Lili Mar 13, 2025: The customer is considering purchasing through **Adobe.com** due to its highly competitive pricing. To encourage them to buy from us, we have already offered a **rebate**.  
We are currently waiting for the customer to review our latest financial proposal.

Lili Mar 06, 2025: We sent the financial proposal on Wednesday, March 5th. We have a meeting scheduled with the customer on Wednesday, March 12th to receive their feedback and determine if any adjustments are needed.

Lili Feb 28, 2025: Today, Friday, February 28, an **Adobe Day** will be held with the client on **FF**. The goal is to meet next week so they can provide the final numbers for the proposal and confirm whether they want to include **Frame IO** and additional licensing in their contract.

Lili Feb 14, 2025: Last week, we presented a proposal, but the client requested financing options and the possibility of making the purchase in Mexican pesos. We are currently working with the Digita team to evaluate the best option.  
Additionally, the client is interested in learning more about Frame IO, so we have scheduled a meeting with Gustavo on Friday, February 21, to provide them with a detailed overview of the solution. On February 28, we will also hold an *Adobe Day* with Rafael, where they will be shown the latest updates on *Frame IO*, *FF*, and *Stock*.

Participants: 
Nelson (IT Manager of Innovation)
Pessini (T Director)

o Voomp
Image generation by information producers. Currently, many information producers create and upload content on our Voomp Creators platform. We have a great opportunity to offer image generation and editing services for content creation and marketing campaigns
o Martech
Today, we have an in-house creative team for creating and deploying advertising pieces for digital media (Google, Meta, TikTok, and whatever else we use in digital) and another creative team for Trade and SEO content. In other words, all the campaigns we launch have some type of image and video media that Firefly could help us with
o Academic
I understand that we are already piloting the Adobe CMS within Cogna, however, I understand that it will take some time for all journeys to be within the CMS process, therefore, if we can make Firefly available through other platforms, we understand that we will have a great gain in operational efficiency.

Current volume of image generation within Cogna IA Corporate Chat;

JV 04/21/2025:  
1. Reason why you believe it’s going to happen:  
After several meetings with Teresa Castillo and Ruben Jaureguí, the client confirms that the justification for the budget approval was sent to the “Agencia Nacional Digital”, from which a response is expected by April 28 due to processing times. We supported the client with information from Acrobat DC that we hope help them in this step. If they have no objections, the process will be opened as a priority in order to achieve the closing and awarding the last week of May. Several letters with CCE licensing requests have arrived at IPN, so they have a pressing event to make the purchase.

 2. Every step since this week to the closed week that need to happen: 
Once they receive the aforementioned approval, they will open a priority purchase process, which we estimate could be released in May. For now the best estimation that we can havdoe according to the times of other cases is:
- April 30: Tender Publication  
- May 6: Q&A session  
- May 12: Opening of economic proposal  
- May 19: Publication of selected reseller  
- May 26–30: Purchase order placed with Adobe

3. DD Status (Due Diligence) & 4. Legal stairs

5. Credit and budget
Waiting budget approvals.

AMIRA 4/14/2025
The market study has already begun and has been sent to the institutions that approve budgets to obtain purchase approval. We are awaiting this step in order to begin the bidding process, which may take an additional month. If the bidding process cannot be initiated this month, it will be postponed to the following month. We are on a two-week vacation period in education, and the process will likely be a little slower.


AMIRA 4-4-2025
I don't have a new status, time of this week for vacation time. 

AMIRA 3-27-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval, and the client is seeking budget approval and internal justification to give the green light to launch the formal bidding process, which can take from 15 days to a month.


AMIRA 3-21-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval.

AMIRA 3-13-2025
The client has already launched the market study, and the channels have submitted their proposals. We are awaiting the client's decision to close the agreement in April 2025 for one year. We have already received deal desk approval.

AMIRA 3-6-2025
The market study was launched this week and the channels have until March 11th to send proposals. The review process normally lasts 1 month. The market study document does not specify steps or execution dates, but it is estimated that by the end of March we will have the winning channel of the process.
Special conditions: 9-month contract, 45 days credit.
Waiting for deal desk approval about 9 month contract.

AMIRA 2-28-2025
The market study process is about to be released, and the review of the proposals may take an additional month. The problem we have now is that the client needs to acquire only 9 months until December and in January start a 3-year agreement. We are in talks with operations to obtain this exception.

AMIRA 2-13-25
Secretaria de Hacienda released the budget but not the document to be able to execute it, they are waiting for this document so that they can execute the 2025 budget because the government practically never delivered it in 2024, the next steps are: --
1. have the document from the treasury
accredit Palo Tinto to sell the government
2. carry out a market study
3. start a tender with an approximate duration of 20 business days
4. failure of the tender


Amira 1-14-25
Hi team, about IPN, 
Secretaria de Hacienda released the budget but not the document to be able to execute it, they are waiting 


for this document so that they can execute the 2025 budget because the government practically never delivered it in 2024, the next steps are: --
 
1. Technical annex for which the IPN already has 
2. Market study that will begin this week 
3.Feasibility study that may take (5 business days) 
4. Approval of the internal committee (IPN Approvals and Purchases Committee) (15 business days) 
5. Approval of digital strategy (15 business days) 
6. Tender (20 business days) Invitation to at least 3 suppliers
 
It is important to mention that the Mexican government is not allocating funds for public education. It has a new software factory initiative so that its institutions can manufacture their own software and not depend on third parties. They are waiting for the budget to be executed by 2025 and for the government to stop keeping these funds. This is the greatest risk we have now.
 
Amira, Jan 13, 2025, 
Today I have a face-to-face meeting with Teresa, IPN's IT manager, to define the next steps and times that the project can take. Once I have them, I will make the corresponding report. They told me that the new market study should be released this week.

Jan 10, 2025: No change in status. There will be an update from IPN about the final budget assigned and if the approval process will start over again. 

AMIRA 12-20-24
The client told us that they will have a response today or on Monday based on the review of the proposals. The response may or may not be favorable. If it is favorable, they will tell us the channel they want to work with, and if it is not favorable, we will have to wait for the budget to be released in January 2025 and start the approval process again.

AMIRA 12-12-24
Since Friday, December 6th, the participating channels Digita, Tenker and Palo Tinto sent their proposals to the client for review. This week, these proposals are being reviewed. They are looking to decide on the best option based on these proposals and not have to go out to tender, since they must award the contract to the channel in December, or they will lose the funds.

AMIRA 12-6-24
This week, the quotes and documentation were requested from the 3 suppliers selected by the IPN. They told us that the formal invitation process for 3 would take place the following week in order to have the tender result on December.

AMIRA 12-2-24
1. This week we need the result from Hacienda for use the budget, Once the budget is available, it will be decided whether it is done by direct award or by invitation to 3; this is decided by the acquisitions committee within the IPN.
This process by invitation to 3 takes 15 days to execute so it is still December.
4. Once the above is fulfilled, the Deal Desk sends us the PSO and Nexsys has to sign the PSO

AMIRA 11-25-24
1. We are waiting for the direct award to be issued by the IPN
2. We are waiting for the compliance agreement between Adobe and Palo Tinto to be signed
3. Nexsys confirms to us today if the line of credit for the channel is approved
4. Once the above is fulfilled, the Deal Desk sends us the PSO and Nexsys has to sign the PSO

AMIRA 11-18-24
Adobe, waiting for credit approval so that Nagaraj can release the agreements and send them for signature.
IPN, today is not a working day in Mexico but this week the direct award should be released and the agreements signed between IPN and the Palo Tinto Networks channel.
Palo Tinto is already a certified Adobe channel and also already has a credit line in Nexsys to be able to place the order.

AMIRA 11-8-24
I requested legal documents from Clarice. I am waiting for them and the letter from Vinay for the partnr Palo Tinto Networks requested by the client. It seems that it will be a direct award that will be made in November 2024.

AMIRA 11-4-24
last week the only approval of the Treasury was released so that IPN can bid, this week the bidding process will begin, which is expected to last 20 working days.

AMIRA 10-28-24
These are the points we touched on in last Thursday's session
1. We still need to check if the market study is still valid or if it needs to be requested again from the (General Directorate of Programming and Budget). It takes approximately 5 days for validation. This Friday the request would be released in case the previous one is no longer valid.

2. The technical annex will remain the same, only the dates would be changed.

3. Apostilled letters for the invited channels have already been requested.

4. We need to validate if the bidding process can be carried out in shorter times. Even so, it is expected to take 15 to 20 days to execute it.

5. It is one of the most advanced projects, so we will be able to complete it this year.

AMIRA 10-20-24
After several meetings, we are still looking for the Treasury to approve that it can be tendered this year, otherwise we have to ask for approvals from CEDN again and wait for the budget for the following year to be released and the size could be closed until March, April 2025, I asked Javier, my boss, to send an email to Eng. Leonardo Rafael Sánchez Ferreiro (General Coordinator of the National Computing Center) (rsferrei@ipn.mx) to ask him to support us by speeding up the process and prioritizing it.
Since October 15, they no longer have service, I asked the CSM for support to detect what the systems show because despite not having service, the IT area has not had any complaints.
I already have a meeting next Thursday with Maria Teresa, head of IT, to review the tender bases.


AMIRA 10-15-24
The risk was detected on May 6th, 2024, CEDN (Coordination of National Digital Strategy) approved the project for Instituto Politecnico Nacional for its 2024 software licensing, a process that took 6 months. Due to the electoral period, Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico communicates that the acquisitions were suspended, our election in Mexico was on June 2th and the statement indicated that they would be reactivated in October 2024.

Next step: Monday I'll meet with Guilherme Stefanini (Global CMO).
As our main challenge is to sell value, and the current interlocutors are only looking at budget & investment, I asked for an agenda with Guilherme to show him what they would give up leaving the ETLA model, part of the value we offer is the Ed 4+ with Translation & Lip Sync with more credits, after all, Stefanini has presence in more than 40 countries and they produce a lot of localized content.

The client had a 3-year contract with a renewal date of 3/27/2027. The government did not release the funds in time, and therefore the process will be delayed by 2 months. A restructuring is required. The start date will be changed to 5/28/2025 and the end date will be 5/28/2026. It will now be for 1 year, not 3, due to government risks. The funds are growing by USD 58,535. We are waiting for the funds to be released so the bidding process can begin, and we can determine the winner.

Diego understood both technologies can help TAM, but there is a concern regarding security, that's why they migrated from I Love PDF to Acrobat - and I explained that the AIA security is the same as Acrobat and I shared all the security information the day after the meeting.

I just sent an email asking Diego about a decision, if they will migrate or we should  proceed with the True Up.

They are on vacation, they return on April 21, 2025, they are in their 2nd year because their contract expires in 2027, they confirmed to us that only 100 licenses will be grown with a value of 9545 USD, they are trying to avoid a tender because this would delay the process but upon returning from vacation they will define whether they have to hold a tender or not and if so, they would be one month late in paying the licensing and we would have to generate a restructuring to change the start and end date, again this problem of generating 3-year contracts for government accounts.

I don't have a new status, time of this week for vacation time. 

AMIRA 3-27-2025
This is an annuity that expires on April 30, 2027. The client is currently requesting an additional 100 licenses, but we don't have the final scenario yet. We hope to have it next week to begin working with the deal desk on the agreements.


AMIRA 3-21-2025
We had a call this week with the client, and although they have duplicate users due to a poor console migration, they aren't using additional users. They are defining the final scenario for their renewal. They will deliver it to us next week, although the amount will most likely be lower.


AMIRA 3-13-2025
This week, a notification of overuse was sent to the client. We have a meeting next Wednesday to review this issue.

AMIRA 3-6-2025
Checking in the console we found and over usage of 1279 creative licenses, Vane CSM is writing an email to notify the client, they are about to pay their 2nd annual contract payment, it is likely that this over usage is not budgeted, and we will have to negotiate it, we wait that the client will give us a meeting next week.","CREATIVE FLAGSHIP","$0","0","","","","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","May 6, 2025","$0","DME FIELD RESELLER LATAM ENT HISPANICS EDU","","DIF","$118,917.76","$0","Stayed with Incumbent","Mar 7, 2025","Sales Organic","14","True-up Placeholder","Q2","Omitted","Education - Higher Ed","ETLA- Hybrid","","0065Y00001nIVZiQAO","USD","0.0","-1.0"
